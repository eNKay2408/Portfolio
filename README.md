## 🧟 <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>
*Welcome to My Portfolio, the **FINAL** of 4 major projects I’ve built as part of my journey to create a strong portfolio for my first job application. As this is one of my first major project README files, some mistakes are to be expected. If you encounter any issues or need further support, please don't hesitate to reach out via the contact information below. I truly appreciate your understanding and thank you so much for taking the time to visit this project!* 😚

Oh, what an incredible feeling! As I write these lines, I have completed all four projects in this series, and this is also the last README file I need to write, hehe. For me, this project is the easiest of all because I was already familiar with the technologies involved. Moreover, it only requires Front-end knowledge to execute. I did encounter some challenges in visualizing the 3D space to design these objects, but the excitement it brings is truly worth it. I spent an entire afternoon just exploring and playing with 3D models and other 3D websites.

Through this project, I have been genuinely amazed by the superiority of modern Front-end technologies that Three.js offers. Additionally, this project has provided me with new knowledge about motion websites and direct email services. I want to share with you that this is my favorite project because it not only provides a wealth of knowledge but also evokes memories of my personal growth from the past to the present. As I crafted the content for the website, many cherished memories flooded back, making this experience invaluable to me 💞.

## ✈️ <a name="devops">DevOps</a>

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

### 🖥️ Development 
#### 1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/eNKay2408/Portfolio.git
cd Portfolio
```

#### 2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

#### 3. Set Up Environment Variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
  ```
  VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
  VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
  VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
  ```
- This tutorial video will guide you through the process of setting up EmailJS: [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgVjild0C9A) (Only watch the first 3min).
- This is the template I used for the contact form:
  ```
  Hello {{to_name}},

  You got a new message from {{from_name}} ({{from_email}}):

  {{message}}

  Best wishes,
  EmailJS team
  ```

#### 4. Start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```

#### 5. Open the browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the application.

#### 6. Make changes to the code and see the changes reflected in real-time.

### 🔄 CI/CD

#### 1. Create GitHub repository and add remote URL to the local repository.
- Because GitLab CI/CD is used for building and deploying the application
- The code is hosted on GitHub and the CI/CD pipeline is triggered using a webhook.

#### 2. Setup AWS S3 and IAM:
- Setup AWS S3 bucket for hosting the static assets: Follow this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l83oqcaTHg) for step-by-step instructions.
- Create an IAM user and generate access keys: Follow this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39X5WdZbEwQ) 

  (**NOTE:** Choose Command Line Interface (CLI) instead of Application running outside AWS).

#### 3. Set up CI/CD on GitLab:
- Create a new empty project on GitLab.
- Replace `$GITHUB_REPO_URL` with your repository URL in the local `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. Then copy this file to the root of your GitLab repository.
- Go to Settings > CI/CD > Variables and add the following environment variables: 
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: IAM user access key.
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: IAM user secret key.
  - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`: AWS region. (e.g., `us-east-1`)
  - `S3_BUCKET`: S3 bucket name.
  - `GITHUB_REPO`: GitHub repository name.
  - `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`: EmailJS service ID (same as `.env` file).
  - `VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`: EmailJS template ID (same as `.env` file).
  - `VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`: EmailJS public key (same as `.env` file).
- Add a trigger token in the CI/CD settings.

#### 4. Add Webhook to GitHub:
- Go to GitHub repository > Settings > Webhooks > Add Webhook.
- Add the GitLab trigger URL and the trigger token:
`https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<GITLAB_PROJECT_ID>/trigger/pipeline?token=<TRIGGER_TOKEN>&ref=main`
- Replace `<GITLAB_PROJECT_ID>` with your GitLab project ID and `<TRIGGER_TOKEN>` with your trigger token.

#### 5. Push the code to GitHub:
- Push the code to the GitHub repository.
- The GitLab CI/CD will be triggered automatically.
- Once the pipeline is successful, the application will be deployed to AWS S3.

#### 6. Open the browser and navigate to the S3 bucket URL to view the deployed application.
